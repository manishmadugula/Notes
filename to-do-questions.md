- There are some villages near a city in India that have yet to be connected to the city via road. Some villages are connected to each other via road and some aren’t. A village is said to be connected to the city if one can travel from that village to the city via any road.The cost of making a road between a city and a village and that of between a village and another village is the same and equal to 1 unit.Find the minimum cost the government must bear in order to connect all the villages to the city.Input: N: number of villages. Matrix: M[N+1][N+1] where 0 to N-1 indexes represents a village and the Nth index represents a city. M[x][y] = M[y][x] = 1 if there is a road between x and y.

## Leadership principles

### Customer Obsession
- You seek customer feedback and it helped
- An instance where the customer came up with unreasonable demands and you pushed back
- The time when measuring customer experience
- When was the last time when you had to compromise a requirement due to lack of time.
- Who was your most difficult customer?
- Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
- Tell the story of the last time you had to apologize to someone.
- Last time you couldn’t deliver on time.

### Ownership
- Tell me about a time when you had to leave a task unfinished.
- Tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities.
- Something challenging you took out of your responsibility, what was the outcome

### Invent and Simplify
- Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem.

- Explain a situation where you have taken an initiative in the current role that helped the team/company in a quantitative way.

### Are Right, A Lot
- Tell me about a time when you were wrong.
- Tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information.

### Learn and Be Curious
- Tell me about a time when you influenced a change by only asking questions.

-  Tell me about a time when you solved a problem through just superior knowledge or observation.

### Hire and Develop The Best

- Tell me about a time when you mentored someone.

### Insist on the Highest Standards
- Tell me about a time when you couldn’t meet your own expectations on a project.

### Think Big
- Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.
  
- Tell me about a time when you went way beyond the scope of the project and delivered.


### Bias for Action
- Describe a time when you saw some problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it.

- Tell me about a time when you took a calculated risk.

- Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?

### Frugality
- Tell me about a time when you had to work with limited time or resources.

### Earn Trust

### Dive Deep
- Give me two examples of when you did more than what was required in any job experience.


### Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
- Tell me about an unpopular decision of yours.
- Tell me about a time when you had to step up and disagree with a team members approach.
- If your direct manager was instructing you to do something you disagreed with, how would you handle it?

### Deliver Results
- By providing an example, tell me when you have had to handle a variety of assignments. Describe the results.
- What is the most difficult situation you have ever faced in your life? How did you handle it?
- Give me an example of a time when you were 75% of the way through a project, and you had to pivot strategy–how were you able to make that into a success story?

### Stories
- Migrations Story with Igor
  - Also time constraint and needed communication.
- Distributed Locking story, how it was going in the wrong direction.
  - Used Spring's Locking integration, lock registry.
- Performance Improvement, was vague
  - Identified the Network fallacy.
  - Changed the indexes in database
  - Reduced the number of API calls.
  - Added joins and referential integrity constraints.
- Story about how copy was causing concurrency concerns.
  - This was challenging as the there was hard time constraint on testing since the release date was nearing
- Optimizing build times in C#
  - Went out of my line to innovate something.
- Fact that being 2A, you are leading a team of 3 and 2Bs
- Bad Idea, Spring Webflux.
- STARR (Situation Task Action Result and Retrospect)

### Sort these
- Most challenging Project
- The time when you got bad feedback from your manager
- The time when you help a teammate
- Some situational questions like a situation where you were helped out a colleague, etc
- Explain a situation where you solved a problem which had a lot of time constraint associated with it.
- Explain a situation where you had to go deep to resolve an issue.
- The time when you pushing your idea
- The time when your idea was rejected
- Why Changing Company.
- Why amazon.
- Explain few answers in the previous interviews that you would like to change now.
- Some situational questions like a situation where you came up with a quick solution to save time.
- Conflict with manager
- How did you handle tasks with a strict deadline?
- How do you go about approaching a new task at hand?
- Situational questions like the biggest technical challenge I faced, A situation where I had to fix someone else’s bug, etc.
 - A contribution that you are proud of and made a big impact.
- A case when you had a conflict with your manager or lead regarding a design.
- A case when you messed something up and how did you handle it. How did your manager respond to this?
- Something that you learnt working closely with your manager.

- low-level design of a bus booking platform (Similar to MakeMyTrip for Buses)
- HackerRank platform
- design FileFinder
- Elaborate on the software designs that you have created in you work.
- Design a Chess Game. 
- Design a Logger.
  
## HLD
- design Slack messenger.
  - Functional and Non Functional Requirements
  - High level architecture
  - Partitioning Key, Primary Key of database
- Design Twitter
- Design a bulk update records/files kind of API for a client.
- Design a file sharing system with Version control of files. (Dropbox)
- Design an IP Blocking system. Asked for multiple approaches along with their pros and cons
- Design a Job Scheduler. Drawbacks of the system I designed. How to implement a recurring job? Further optimizations.
- Design a feature in Google search which returns “k” most visited websites at any point in time from a log server. A log server provides a trigger whenever a particular website is visited. Low-level implementation is an extension of K most frequent elements in an array. I started off with sorting and moved to Heaps, took me time to get there after struggling. I was asked to write APIs for each operation considering this feature and all design principles that were involved in the design

## Tips
- In the design rounds, interviewer doesn’t expect the most ideal answer from you and unless your choice of technology is outrageously wrong, he won’t pinpoint that.
- Behavior questions take lots of time, and it’s very important to have different prepared stories for them. You can you same story for different questions if you can show the required aspect.
- On the technical part, the most important thing is the idea, because you have only 25 mins. 
- You will not have a compilator, so small mistakes in syntax are not so important.
- You should write clean code, but always ask the recruiter if he wants you to implement methods or not. it will help you to save time and focus on important parts.
- The Amazon interviewers are very friendly and give you hints if you get stuck. Be sure to handle every edge case and come up with multiple approaches wherever feasible.
- Design questions are broad and intentionally left vague, ask relevant questions to understand the problem better. Interviewers would be happy if you put up right questions.
- There is no perfect solution to design problems. The whole point is to understand how good are you in solving real use cases.


## System Design
- Ask good questions, and clarify the feature scale.
  - Functional and Non functional requirements
  - Non functional requirements
    - HA
    - Read to write ratio
    - Scalability
    - Low Latency
    - Consistency or not.
    - Durability
- How much to scale i.e Capacity planning
  - How much data to store
- API exposed (takes api_key/bearer token)
  - Register Accounts
  - validate account
- Architecture design
- Latency requirements
  - Cache
  - CDNs
  - Edge (Dedicated network going through private network not public internet)
  - Async
- Availability
  - Single Point of Failure
- Scalability
  - Auto Scaling Groups
  - Containers/Orchestration.
- Security
  - OAuth
  - API Key
